# swift-parca

`swift-parca` supports continuous low-overhead profiling of Swift Server applications at scale, for always-on tracking of performance issues in production.

`swift-parca` is a fully packaged solution that extends [Parca](https://www.parca.dev), an open-source continuous profiling tool that embeds [opentelemetry-ebpf-profiler](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-profiler) for creating low overhead samples, with native support for Swift symbol demangling.

Parca consists of an agent that runs on each node that is under monitoring as well as a server that aggregates all the profiling data for analysis using familiar tools such as flamegraphs and sample overviews.

Example of reviewing `swift-build` stacks:

Example of `swift-nio` benchmark:

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
`swift-parca` is provided as a single, pre-configured Docker container image that bundles Parca and all necessary dependencies, to simplify profiling of Swift applications at scale.

To begin profiling your Swift application, follow these simple steps:

1. Start the Parca Server

Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to bring up the Parca server:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts the Parca server, listening on HTTP port 7070 for UI and profiling data from agents.

2. Start the Parca Agent

On each server running your Swift workloads, deploy the `parca-agent`:
```bash
export REMOTE_STORE_ADDRESS=<PARCA_SERVER_IP>:7070
docker-compose -f docker-compose.agent.yml up -d
```

## Documentation

For further setup and usage instructions, please refer to the [Parca Documentation](https://www.parca.dev/docs/overview).

## Background 

Parca normally uses a [Go demangler](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle) which [lacks Swift symbol](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle/issues/16) demangling. 

This project addresses this limitation by configuring Parca to delegate address-to-line lookups and symbol demangling to a custom `swift-addr2line` embedded tool. This tool leverages the native Swift runtime function for demangling, ensuring accurate and human-readable stack traces, while relying on a Rust-based [`gimli` addr2line](https://github.com/gimli-rs/addr2line) (or to [`llvm-addr2line`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-addr2line.html)) for actual address lookup. 

This direct access of the native Swift runtime function is needed until [SE-262](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0262-demangle.md) is formally integrated into the standard library.

## Using llvm-addr2line

If you want to use [`llvm-addr2line`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-addr2line.html) instead of the `gimli-rs/addr2line`, uncomment the line containing `apt-get install -y llvm-19` in the Dockerfile.

This installs the LLVM tools, making the binary available at `/usr/bin/llvm-addr2line-19`.

Then you need to update the `docker-compose.yml` environment:

```bash
    environment:
      - ADDR2LINE_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-addr2line-19
```

## Requirements

The container is packaged for Linux x86_64 and ARM64. It is possible to run entirely under a Linux VM (with kernel 5.4+) under Apple sillicon.
